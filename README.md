Let me talk you more about me :
- ðŸ‘€ I can say i'm an eternal learner. After exploring the digital world, my life took at least a 270-degree turn. I discovered that I was drawn to the world of data, analysis and code. So I embarked on a bootcamp course on Data Analysis. That was the first big step on which my other steps were based as I continued my training on my own. I went on to complete the "Python for Data Science" course on the IBM skillsBuild platform.
- ðŸŒ± I'm enrolled in a training course to become an IA Developer and now I'm looking to join a company that's prepared to support me along the way so that I can quickly become more independent.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m starting Git and Github comprehension, it'll be necessary !

- âš¡ Fun fact: Before I was a teacher of spanish language in "Education National" in France ! I love grammar and linguistics ! 

Well, you might ask why my README Repo starts by "Xolo". It comes from "Xoloitzcuintle" : a majestic and native dog from mexican culture. If you saw "Coco" film, you know what i'm talking about !
